# DCGAN-keras
Implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network using keras with tensorflow backend.
The generate image file contains the results plotted using matplotlib.

Requirements :
Jupyter Notebook
Python3
Keras
TensorFlow
matplotlib
tqdm ( for progress bar )
h5py ( for saving and loading model )

The model was trained using the MNIST dataset and will be downloaded when the code is run. There is no need to download it separately.
To generate images just run the Generate_image.ipynb file.
